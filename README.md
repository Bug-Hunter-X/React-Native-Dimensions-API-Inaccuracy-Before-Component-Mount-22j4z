This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug related to using the `Dimensions` API before a component has fully mounted. The `DimensionsBug.js` file showcases the problem where incorrect dimensions are fetched, causing layout problems. The `DimensionsBugSolution.js` provides a solution using `useEffect` and `Dimensions.addEventListener` to ensure accurate dimensions are obtained after the component is ready.
